This repository contains an Angular application, that Ive made for my Exam in the Angular subject on the JavaScrit Developer postgraduate studies on Bialystok University of Technology.
An app is a popular snake game, where we eat the food to grow and gain the points. Core of the game originates from ngx-snake external module made by Chrystian Ruminowicz.
My snake app is divided into two components - start page with a form and game page
In order to start the game, we have to fullfill simple form containing with player name and e-mail adress.
Game page contains main game window with movement, start, stop and pause buttons, history of players moves and results from the current game.
